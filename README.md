End-Portal-Calculator

Use the python file by inputting the coordinates of an end portal, and the python script will output all locations
of end portals and the coords you should build a nether portal to get close to the portal. This is not an exact
script, and is therefore not considered cheating, like how using chunkbase to find the exact coordinates of
all of the end portals would be.
